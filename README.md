# Hackedin Block Game

## Developing
This project requires NodeJS v12+ and yarn. Clone this repo and run `yarn` to setup the dependencies. You can start a test server that displays just the game using `yarn start`. You can run the code linter using `yarn lint`. When a new version is ready to be published to NPM, you can use `yarn build` to create the `dist` folder for publication.
