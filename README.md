# Hackedin Block Game
This project was built for an internal hackathon at my first co-op Mappedin. We created a tetris-clone that could be packaged as a npm-module and hid it within the careers page of the Mappedin website as an easter egg for potential-future employees to enjoy :)

## Developing
This project requires NodeJS v12+ and yarn. Clone this repo and run `yarn` to setup the dependencies. You can start a test server that displays just the game using `yarn start`. You can run the code linter using `yarn lint`. When a new version is ready to be published to NPM, you can use `yarn build` to create the `dist` folder for publication.

## Playing the game
Use the `A` and `S` keys to rotate the blocks, `D` to hold a piece for later, the `left` and `right` keys to move, and the `up key` to drop a block in place!
